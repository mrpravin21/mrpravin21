# Hi, I'm Pravin 👋

I’m a final-year Information Technology engineering student with a strong interest in building reliable, scalable software systems. I enjoy working across the stack—from designing clean user interfaces to developing backend services and working with databases and infrastructure.

Most of my work revolves around turning ideas into practical applications, experimenting with new technologies, and strengthening my engineering fundamentals through hands-on projects.
